			<p>
			What's 75 million years old and brand spanking new? A teenage Utahceratops! Come to the
			Saroyan, armed with your best dinosaur roar, when Scott Sampson, Research Curator at the
			Utah Museum of Natural History, steps to the podium. Sampson's research has focused on the
			ecology and evolution of late Cretaceous dinosaurs and he has conducted fieldwork in a number
			of countries in Africa.
			<br>
			<br>
			Scott Sampson is a Canadian-born paleontologist who received his Ph.D. in zoology from the
			University of Toronto. His doctoral work focused on two new species of ceratopsids, or horned
			dinosaurs, from the Late Cretaceous of Montana, as well as the growth and function of certopsid
			horns and frills.
			<br>
			<br>
			Following graduation in 1993, Sampson spent a year working at the American Museum of Natural
			History in New York City, followed by five years as assistant professor of anatomy at the New
			York College of Osteopathic Medicine on Long Island. He arrived at the University of Utah
			accepting a dual position as assistant professor in the Department of Geology and Geophysics
			and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Utah Museum of Natural History. His research
			interests largely revolve around the phylogenetics, functional morphology, and evolution of
			Late Cretaceous dinosaurs.
			<br>
			<br>
			In addition to his museum and laboratory-based studies, Sampson has conducted paleontological
			work in Zimbabwe, South Africa, and Madagascar, as well as the United States and Canada. He was
			also the on-air host for the Discovery Channel's Dinosaur Planet and recently completed a book,
			Dinosaur Odyssey: Fossil Threads in the Web of Life, which is one of the most
			comprehensive surveys of dinosaurs and their worlds to date.
